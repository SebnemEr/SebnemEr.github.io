The English site works via the Quarto file index.qmd in

C:\Users\01438475\OneDrive - University of Cape Town\GitHub\newsite

First, start the Rproject "website.Rproj" in R.
Then go to index.qmd file.
Make changes and then render.

Whatever is rendered will appear under _site folder. Copy the html file to the actual github page under English.
This is very important to copy to the right place, ie:

C:\Users\01438475\OneDrive - University of Cape Town\GitHub\SebnemEr.github.io\english

Main landing page is not changed. It is still the ferry - turkish/english giris-enter page.

All I changed was the english - enter stuff.

Once you copy to the github folder then go to Github desktop, and give a name to your changes and commit to master.
After that push to origin.

You need to be in the C:\Users\01438475\OneDrive - University of Cape Town\GitHub\SebnemEr.github.io as your current repository.
