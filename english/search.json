    "text": "I was born in 1978 is Istanbul. I completed my Management Engineering undergraduate education in 2001 at Istanbul Technical University and graduated from the PhD of Quantitative Methods in 2009 at Istanbul University. I worked as a research assistant in Istanbul University School of Business Quantitative Methods Department between 2003-2013. In January 2013, I joined University of Cape Town Statistical Sciences Department as a lecturer. I am currently a senior lecturer and the program coordinator for MSc Data Science degree at UCT, Statistical Sciences Department. My academic interests consist of spatial statistical models and machine learning algorithms applied in different areas such as agriculture, ecology and health sciences.\nHere you will find information about me, links to my publications, workshop that I was involved in, my research areas and websites for the courses I teach. If you follow the Turkish site, you will also find about my personal interests and travels."

    "text": "Requirements\n\nExternal libraries (requirements vary by OS)\nWe’re going to be doing all our spatial analysis and plotting today in R. Behind the scenes, R provides bindings to powerful open-source GIS libraries. These include the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and Interface to Geometry Engine Open Source (GEOS) API suite, as well as access to projection and transformation operations from the PROJ.4 library. You needn’t worry about all this, but for the fact that you may need to install some of these external libraries first. The requirements vary by OS:\n\nLinux: Requirements vary by distribution. See here.\nMac: You should be fine to proceed directly to the R packages installation below. An unlikely exception is if you’ve configured R to install packages from source; in which case see here.\nWindows: Same as Mac, you should be good to go unless you’re installing from source. In which case, see here.\n\n\n\nR packages\n\nNew: sf, lwgeom, maps, mapdata, spData, tigris, tidycensus, leaflet, tmap, tmaptools\nAlready used: tidyverse, hrbrthemes\n\nNote that you’ll need ggplot2 version 3.0.0 or above for the required plotting support of sf objects. That’s almost certainly the case, but now is a good time to upgrade you existing packages if you haven’t done that for a while.\nOkay, let’s install (if necessary) and load everything. As per usual, I’ll also set my preferred plotting theme, but this is unnecessary.\n\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\")\n\nWarning: package 'pacman' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, hrbrthemes, lwgeom, rnaturalearth, maps, mapdata, spData, tigris, tidycensus, leaflet, tmap, tmaptools)\ntheme_set(hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum())\n\n\n\nCensus API key"
