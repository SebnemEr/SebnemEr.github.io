ColumnName,Description
Group,identity of pied babbler group - three letter code
Season,"identity of breeding season - single letter code, represents the time period September to March"
NestCode,"Identity of each nest incubated - same identity applied to the brood if the eggs hatched. Code = Group ID, N for nest, number - for number of nest with 1 being the first clutch laid and incubated in the season, season ID"
IncPeriod,Number of days that the nest was incubated until the clutch either hatched or failed
IncPeriodHatchedNests,"Number of days that the nest was incubated until the clutch either hatched or failed, excluding all failed nests"
BroodPeriod,Number of days that nestlings survived until the brood either fledged or failed
BroodPeriodFledgedNests,"Number of days that nestlings survived until the brood either fledged or failed, excluding all failed nests"
Period90,"Number of days that the fledgling/s that survived the longest survived - 90 days if they reached nutritional independence, <90 days if they died before that"
TotPerCutOff,"Total number of days between the start of incubation and nutritional independence or failure, cut-off at a maximum of 120 days"
Event,"Whether or not brood failure occurred, where 0 = no failure, 1  = failure (Cox model requires that event = Death)"
HatchCatNum,"Whether or not the clutch hatched, where 0 = failed, 1 = hatched"
EventInc,"Whether or not the clutch hatched, where 0 = hatched, 1 = failed (Cox model requires that event = Death)"
FledgeCatNum,"Whether or not at least one chick from the brood fledged, where 0 = no fledglings, 1 = at least one fledgling"
EventBr,"Whether or not at least one chick from the brood fledged, where 0 = at least one fledgling, 1 = no fledglings (Cox model requires that event = Death)"
FledgeExclNotHatched,"Whether or not at least one chick from the brood fledged, where 0 = no fledglings, 1 = at least one fledgling, excluding nests that did not hatch"
NoChicksHatched,Number of hatched nestlings if known
NoChicksFledged,Number of nestlings that fledged

PropHotDaysBr,Proportion of days between hatching and fledging equal to or exceeding 35.5 degrees C
MeanTmax90,Mean daily maximum air temperature between fledging and nutritional independence at 90 days or brood failure
PropHotDays90,Proportion of days between fledging and nutritional independence at 90 days or brood failure equal to or exceeding 35.5 degrees C
Rain90,Total rainfall between fledging and nutritional independence
PairTenure,Number of consecutive seasons that the same two birds have made the dominant pair at the group
LongestDom,Number of consecutive seasons that the longest-running dominant individual in the group has been dominant in that or another group
AveTmax,Mean daily maximum air temperature between start of incubation and nutritional independence at 90 days or brood failure
AvePropHot,Proportion of days between start of incubation and nutritional independence at 90 days or brood failure equal to or exceeding 35.5 degrees C
TotRain,Total rainfall between 60 days before the start if incubation and nutritional independence at 90 days or brood failure
SurvInd,"Whether or not the nest produced at least one fledgling that survived to nutritional independence at 90 days, where 0 = no fledglings survived, 1 = at least one fledling survived"
MeanTminInc,Mean daily minimum air temperature between start of incubation and hatching or clutch failure
MeanTminBr,Mean daily minimum air temperature between start of hatching and fledging or brood failure
MeanTmvarInc,Mean daily air temperature variation (maximum - minimum) between start of incubation and hatching or clutch failure
MeanTvarBr,Mean daily air temperature variation (maximum - minimum) between start of hatching and fledging or brood failure
MeanTmin90,Mean daily minimum air temperature between fledging and nutritional independence at 90 days or brood failure
