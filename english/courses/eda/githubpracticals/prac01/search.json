For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nDelays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using lag(), explore how the delay of a flight is related to the delay of the immediately preceding flight.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nLook at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the air time of a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination.
