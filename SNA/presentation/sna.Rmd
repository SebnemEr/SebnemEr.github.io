title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE, dpi=300)
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Requirements

### External libraries (requirements vary by OS)

We're going to be doing all our spatial analysis and plotting today in R. Behind the scenes, R provides bindings to powerful open-source GIS libraries. These include the [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)](http://www.gdal.org/) and [Interface to Geometry Engine Open Source (GEOS)](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) API suite, as well as access to projection and transformation operations from the [PROJ.4 library](https://proj4.org/about.html). You needn't worry about all this, but for the fact that you *may* need to install some of these external libraries first. The requirements vary by OS:

- **Linux:** Requirements vary by distribution. See [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#linux).
- **Mac:** You should be fine to proceed directly to the R packages installation below. An unlikely exception is if you've configured R to install packages from source; in which case see [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#macos).
- **Windows:** Same as Mac, you should be good to go unless you're installing from source. In which case, see [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#windows).

### R packages 

- **New:** `sf`, `lwgeom`, `maps`, `mapdata`, `spData`, `tigris`, `tidycensus`, `leaflet`, `tmap`, `tmaptools`
- **Already used:** `tidyverse`, `hrbrthemes`

Note that you'll need `ggplot2` version 3.0.0 or above for the required [plotting support](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/07/ggplot2-3-0-0/) of `sf` objects. That's almost certainly the case, but now is a good time to upgrade you existing packages if you haven't done that for a while.

Okay, let's install (if necessary) and load everything. As per usual, I'll also set my preferred plotting theme, but this is unnecessary.

```{r, cache=F, message=F}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, hrbrthemes, lwgeom, rnaturalearth, maps, mapdata, spData, tigris, tidycensus, leaflet, tmap, tmaptools)
theme_set(hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum())
```
